    % PART 2: Peak detection
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % Searching  for  peaks  in  a  source  component  signals(n)was
    % accomplished by a simple peak detection algorithm as follows:
    
    % 1. Scan the signals(n) which may be expected to contain a series
    %   of peaks and determine the maximum value Smax.
    Smax = max(abs(sigToFiltH(i,:)));
    
    % 2.Define a threshold as a fraction of the maximum,Th = 0.6 Smax
    threshold = 0.6*Smax;
    
    % 3. Convert the signal into binary format:
    %       if S1(n)>= Th, S(n)=1
    %       if S1(n)< Th, S(n)=0
    S1(i,sigToFiltH(i,:)>=threshold) = 1;
    S1(i,sigToFiltH(i,:)<threshold) = 0;
    
    % 4. Calculate the rate of change of signal S1(n),
    %   i.e. the first derivativeof S(n), which is approximated as:
    %   s2(n)=s1(n)-s1(n-1),n=2,3, ..., N
    %   where N is the number of samples
    S2(i,1) = 0;
    for j = 2:1:colIcaSig
        S2(i,j) = S1(i,j) - S1(i,j-1);
    end
    
    % 5. Select those samples for which the corresponding S2(n) value is equal
    %   to one, that is, having a positive rate of change:
    %   P={n|s2(n)=1}
    %   The setPdefine as above contains the indices of the peaks ins(n).
    P{i} = find(S2(i,:) == 1);
